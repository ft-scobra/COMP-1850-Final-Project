This is the first ever website project. I have never learnt CSS and JavaScript before this. What little HTML that I knew was from middle school computer science class. All the HTML, CSS and Javascript that I learnt later was at BCIT's COMP-1850.

It took me several hours just to get something simple done in CSS, but over time, I got more and more used to it.

I had to create a website from scratch for my Final Project for COMP-1850: Introduction to Web Development. The website I used for inspiration was a "Game Guide" website called [Prydwen](https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/). I liked the layout of the website and used it as my base. I then worked up from there customizing it to my liking while also changing a few things in the layout. I also added animations/transitions which are not included in the original website.

I took pride in the finished website especially since it was the first fully dunctional website that I've ever made. There are still many improvements that can be made and I can only learn and improve through experience.
